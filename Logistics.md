### Logistics

❖Form
➢ MADTalks will not be a club. Instead, it will be linked directly to the Madison Administration, similar to the SGA. There will be no membership for students, and events will be organized solely by the three MADTalks managers and the administration.

■ Eliminates the possibility of other clubs appealing for access to facilities during school hours
➢ MADTalks will be a new, independent organization located solely at JMHS. The new organization will have no association with any nonprofit or similar external groups.

■ Enables complete flexibility to adapt to the needs of the Madison student body, administration, and managers

■ Reduces hassle for setup and approval by county

❖Who can attend

➢ MADTalks strives to reach all Madison students who may benefit
from exposure to high-level business professionals and entrepreneurs, so talks will be open to all who meet qualifications* in the designated grade level of that talk (e.g. all qualified students in the class of 2019 will have the opportunity to attend the talk for their class)

❖Time and Location

➢ Warhawk Time - Red Monday ➢ Once every 5-7 weeks

➢ Event in Wahawk Hall

### Proposed Methodology

I. Initiation:​ ​From newly-launched big data startups to local family-run restaurants to Fortune 500 management consulting firms, there is a plethora of talented innovators and entrepreneurs in the DC area. Careful decision-making is necessary to balance the interests of students and administration. This phase also includes gaining approval from administration and managing the space and time availability, as well as coordinating with other school activities and schedules.

II. Planning:​ ​After a speaker has been selected and arrangements have been made, we must create a strategy to capitalize on the speaker's expertise and experience. Moreover, a scope statement, step-by-step plan, and customized list of questions will be devised to fully achieve the four objectives of MADTalks of James Madison HS. Additionally, risk planning, estimating resource requirements, and gaining formal approval will take place.

III. Marketing:​ ​In order to attract a sufficient audience that experiences the benefits of the talk, advertising will be accomplished via Madison News Network, social media of MADTalks of James Madison HS, and classes relevant to the respective speaker.

IV. Execution:​ Management of MADTalks of James Madison HS will implement the plan proposed in Phase II and coordinate human resources and other resources to accomplish the scope statement of the talk.

V. Closing:​ ​After the event, administrative activities include archiving relevant files and documenting lesson learned. Finalize all activities related to the event, and conduct post implementation review.
