### MadTalks

MADTalks hinges on the three core values of innovation, leadership, and entrepreneurship. It creates live experiences that bring communities together and renders the three key focuses of the organization accessible in a meaningful way to students. The talks will be organized by the MADTalks of James Madison High School, managed by Sky Zoom, Luke Dobrovic, and Khuslen Jargalan.


### Goals

❖ Inspire​ ​students to use innovation, leadership, and entrepreneurship as a force for good

❖ Enable​ ​students to meet and interact with the pioneers of today’s change

❖ Foster​ ​a more equitable and diverse community of creators and businesspeople

❖ Offer​ ​speakers who employ both ethics and compassion in their fields



### Current Situation and Benefits

The world is full of problems and questions that won’t go away and must be answered, so creative ideas and innovative solutions are needed to solve them. By encouraging students to think with an attitude of ingenuity and enterprise, they have the potential to become contributors to the fast-paced, quickly-changing business world.

High schoolers are often devoid of exposure to high-level professional pursuits. Speakers will serve as unique models for intellectual and creative development and exploration of innovative interests. Students can supplement their core school activities with interaction and discourse with successful role models.

By providing all students with life-changing advice and insights, we aim to bridge the resource gap and foster a more encouraging community of innovators, leaders, and entrepreneurs.
Oftentimes, we overlook the changes and trends occurring immediately around us, which can lead to underestimating the potential of the community. Connecting local business leaders with students from Madison is an opportunity to build community awareness and support.
