## A New Post

MADTalks is a speaker series based at James Madison High School in Vienna,
Virginia. Its management team — Sky Zoom, Luke Dobrovic, and Khuslen
Jargalan — created the organization to expose high school students interested
in business to industry leaders, with the goal of sparking their further
exploration and interest. MADTalks seeks to bring to these students the
diverse perspectives and experiences from leaders in the worlds of finance,
technology, and media.
The 2017-2018 school year is the first academic year that MADTalks will host
talks at James Madison High School. The management team seeks to provide
students with a unique supplement to core classroom instruction through the
talks, and hopes to continue to do so in the years to come.
